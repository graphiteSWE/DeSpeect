## Introduction

### What is DeSpeect?

DeSpeect is a graphical interface for Speect [Meraka Institute (2008-2013)], a library for the creation of vocal synthesis systems, which facilitates the inspection of its internal state during its execution and the writing of tests for its functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Speect Prerequisites

* git (minimum version 2.14.1)
* curl ( minimum version 7.55.1)
* ANSI C/ISO C90 GCC compiler (minimum version 5.0)
* CMAKE (minimum version 2.8)
* SWIG (minimum Version 3.0.10)
* libxml2-dev (minimum version 2.9.4)
* python-dev (minimum version 2.7.14)

#### Despeect Prerequisites

* Unix / Unix-like OS (DeSpeect has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
* CMAKE (minimum version 2.8)
* ANSI C/ISO C90 GCC compiler (minimum version 7.0)
* Qt 5.9.0

### Installing

You can run DeSpeect in two different ways, according to your needs:

1. Developer build
* Clone or download the repository
* Execute the `build.sh` script in the root directory

This will install Speect, create a build for DeSpeect in `DeSpeect/build/` and run the related tests.

2. User build
* Clone or download the repository
* Execute the `Installer.sh` script in the root directory
* Select a destination folder for the installation

This will install Speect and create a build for DeSpeect, without running any test.

## Running the tests

The tests for DeSpeect are implemented through the Google Test framework and they are run at every build by Travis CI.
In order to run the tests locally, you need to perform a developer build which runs the tests automatically. Once you have installed the application, you can run the related tests by entering the build directory (`DeSpeect/build/`) and using either the `ctest` or `unit_tests` commands.

## Usage

### Running the application

You can run DeSpeect in two different ways, depending on how decided to install it:

 1. Developer build
* Enter the bin directory through the `DeSpeect/build/bin/` path
* Start the application executing the `main` file

2. User build
* Enter the root install directory
* Start the executable called `DeSpeect`

## Example - Visualizing the graph

In order to visualize a Speect internal graph, you just need to load a `.json` voice file clicking on the `Load Voice`button in the main window (sample voices are stored in the `SpeectInstaller/voices/` directory), and subsequently execute Speect through the `Run All` or `Run Step` button. Notice that `Run All` will execute all the utterance processors, while `Run Step` will only run the first utterance processor (see [Speect docs](http://speect.sourceforge.net/ "Speect docs" for more information). The following is a detailed sample procedure of how to visualize a graph:

1. Start the application
2. Click on the `Load Voice` button
3. Open the file corresponding the `SpeectInstaller/voices/cmu_arctic_slt/voice.json` path (if you opted for a dev install) or `DeSpeectInstall/Test/cmu_arctic_slt/voice.json` (if you opted for a user install) 
4. Select the desired utterance processors in the homonymous sidebar
5. Click the `Run step` button in order to execute the utterance processors list step by step, or click `Run all` in order to execute the whole list

## Built with

* Qt 5.9 LTS
* CMAKE 2.8
* Speect 1.1.0-69-g65f4
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Travis CI
